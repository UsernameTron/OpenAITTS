Options for both transcription and translation to English
Multiple output formats (plain text, JSON, verbose JSON)
Timestamp granularity selection (segment and word level)
Optional prompt support for improved recognition of specific terms
Results copying and saving functionality

4. Enhanced User Experience

Comprehensive status feedback during processing
Visual progress indicators
Error handling with clear messaging
Responsive design that works across device sizes

Technical Implementation Notes
The implementation uses modern web technologies for a client-side application that:

Securely manages API credentials with optional local storage
Provides visual feedback during processing operations
Handles various file formats and validates them before processing
Offers preview and download capabilities for both text and audio outputs

Deployment Benefits
This implementation offers several advantages:

No Installation Required: The application runs entirely in a browser with no need for command-line tools, package installation, or desktop software setup.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on any modern device with a web browser, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Simple Deployment: The entire application is contained in a single HTML file that can be:

Saved locally and opened directly in a browser
Hosted on any basic web server with no special configuration
Shared easily within organizations


Security Considerations: The application processes data locally and makes direct API calls to OpenAI, maintaining privacy and security.
Extensibility: The modular design makes it easy to add features such as batch processing, additional voice options, or more sophisticated text formatting.
